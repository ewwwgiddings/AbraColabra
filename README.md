# AbraColabra
:sparkles: Providing a platform to collaborate and communicate through multimedia editing and sharing capabilities. :sparkles:

Users can append various forms of multimedia editing tools, collaborate on or view the evolving canvases/scrolls, and connect with other users. Collaborations can be informal conversations, academic/professional design, artwork, knowledge sharing, classifieds, anything. Unlike other social media, the content is dynamic.

AbraColabra is not an open source project. This serves as a place for bug reports, suggestions, and general discussion.
