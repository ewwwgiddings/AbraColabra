# AbraColabra
:sparkles: AbraColabra provides a platform to collaborate, communicate, and edit using multimedia tools. :sparkles:

AbraColabra is a multimedia platform where content is dynamic and evolving, not static. The content is created, altered, and developed, real-time, by the users in both public and private environments.

Users can append various forms of multimedia tools, in order to edit, collaborate, connect, view, or share the evolving canvases. The medium is the message. Collaborations can be informal conversations, academic/professional design, artwork, knowledge sharing, classifieds, anything. Unlike other social media, the content is dynamic.

AbraColabra is not an open source project. This serves as a place for bug reports, suggestions, and/or general discussion.
